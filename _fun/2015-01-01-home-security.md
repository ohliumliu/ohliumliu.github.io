I was able to put together a home surveillance system using a very inexpensive IP camera and open-source softwares. A Kaicong camera is controlled by [ZoneMinder](https://zoneminder.com). When motion is detected in the monitored area, the system is configured to send out a text message and/or an email with a snapshot attached.

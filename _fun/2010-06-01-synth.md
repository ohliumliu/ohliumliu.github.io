Synth can be used to analyze the shape of a sessile or pendant drop to extract surface tension at high accuracy. The program was developed by Lorenzo Busoni, Marcello Carl√†, and Leonardo Lanzi, and described in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1364666). Since the software was released under GNU license, I took the liberty to put it here for further distribution. I found it necessary to tweak the code a little bit according to the operating system, and some of the tweaks, I have to admit, are just quick-and-dirty fixes. That said, the essential functions of the software is retained.

_Edit 2020-02-24
:This instrument is being used in Wuhan, the epic center of COVID-19 outbreak, and demonstrated at least 10-fold improvement of sensitivity with clinical sample when compared with realtime PCR. The researchers also appreciated its reproducibility and easy of use. With the microfluidic chip I designed being used to help patients, it is by far the most rewarding experience in my career._

_Edit 2020-02-06
:This instrument is being used in house to develop a RT-PCR assay to detect 2019-nCov that is responsible for the pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan. Preliminary [result](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/jsGcLZBuWVdB2uWpUBaOjw
) shows the sensitivity is improved by 1-2 orders of magnitude._

After a short break from Complete Genomics, I joined [PreciGenome](www.precigenome.com), a startup based in San Jose, CA, to work on microfluidic instrument and consumables based on droplet technologies. Our Suzhou office, [锐讯生物](http://www.rainsurebio.com/), is marketing an instrument for droplet digital PCR. What sets it apart from existing products on the market is
* more reproducible results due to less hands-on operation
* integrated workflow more amenable to clinical applications
* robust algorithm against droplet size variations
* compatible with a wider selection of reagent system

If the team at Complete Genomics is a "startup" inside an established company, PreciGenome is a real startup with less than a handful of employees in the US. I had the rare opportunity to be involved with the "full stack" of the company's operations ranging from finance, strategy, marketing, research, manufacturing and sales support.

* Company name and logo

    Believe it or not, the name "PreciGenome" had been registered by another entity in China, so a new translation of "锐讯" was needed shortly after I joined the company. I proposed the name RainSure which is officially the English name of the company in China. I also sketched a couple of logos with apparent references to droplet, double helix and Chinese stamp sculpturing as shown below.

    I also drafted company's core values after taking inspiration from a banner at a pharmaceutical startup in South San Francisco. It is intended to be a fusion of western and Chinese culture.

* Collaboration 

    I also collaborated with engineering and assay teams in Suzhou. Besides technical inputs, I tried to influence how research and development is conducted by promoting good engineering practices. I proposed and champagned the adoption of 禅道 as a project management platform. I also demonstrated how to troubleshoot a problems by systematically dissecting the problem and designing control experiments so that root cause is revealed and verified by data instead of mere hypothesis.

* Vendor relationship
   
    Working with vendors is always tricky especially for smaller companies without much leveraging power. I learned how to communicate efficiently in technical discussions. Perhaps more importantly, I gained experience in having difficult conversations with outside vendors.

* Customer relationship

    I am also involved with the support of sales and marketing effort. It provides me with first-hand information of the market requirements. I proposed the actively maintained market survey which drives our research efforts. Whenever the customer has technical issues, I am always consulted. 

    Before aopting a new technology such as ddPCR, customers deserve to know the strengths and limitations at a deeper level. That's why the input of the technical team is essential to the ultimate satisfaction of the customers. My experience helped customers understand the key features and specs of our instrument to achieve their goals efficiently and practically. 
 
* Intellectual property matters

    The IP landscpe of droplet technology is complicated and confusing. Without an in-house attorney, I have to read patents and case opinions to understand the legal implications of our practices. When dealing with lawyers hired by potential investors to perform due deligence, I drafted answers to most of the questions they had. As a by-product, I reflected on a well-publicized lawsuit [here](https://medium.com/@yul.liuyu/some-reflections-on-bio-rad-vs-10x-2bf8d1b70368).

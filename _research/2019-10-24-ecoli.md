Today, the microfluidic sequencer I worked on at Complete Genomics is officially [launched](https://tinyurl.com/yydjtjme) by BGI at ICG-14. It is called DNBSEQ E Series. A little more information could be found in this [brochure](https://en.mgitech.cn/include/upload/kind/file/20191025/20191025094416_3946.pdf). 

Kudos to those toiling at the frontline to turn  management's pipe dream to customers' tangible products. 

It boils down to every drawing delineated, every pin aligned, every reagent concocted and every base called.

Hopefully the anticipated IPO of MGI also brings tangible benefits to the worker bees.

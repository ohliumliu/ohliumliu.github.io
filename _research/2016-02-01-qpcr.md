This [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elps.201670031) is one of my contributions to [&mu;TAS Wako g1](http://www.wako-chem.co.jp/rinyaku/products/g1/index.htm), an automatic, sample-to-answer instrument for molecular diagnostics. The corresponding [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN104471385B/en) has been granted in US, Japan and China .

Another [patent application](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2018100421A1/en?oq=WO2018100421A1) was employed in this product to enhance mixing efficiency at micrometer scale. The physics involved is found in seemingly unrelated areas such as [Rayleigh-Benard convection](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Rayleigh-B%C3%A9nard_convection) and blood flow in heart. It is essentially a miniaturized version of the jet mixer.

Offering my first job out of school, Wako provided a perfect environment for me to develop a product-oriented engineering mindset. At the same time, my apptite for scientific exploration was also fulfilled. I am always indebted to the supportive colleagues at Wako for helping me laying the foundation of a future career.

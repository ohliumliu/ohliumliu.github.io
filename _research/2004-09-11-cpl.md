I was working on theoretical chemistry as an undergraduate researcher with Dr. Jiushu Shao. It was a whole year of dedicated study on quantum mechanics and scientific computation. After graduation I was fortunate enough to co-author a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0009261404010747) from the group. The training in this period allowed me to rapidly pick up a numerical simulation task as a fresh graduate student at Caltech.

As part of the requirement for graduation, three original research proposals were submitted to and reviewed by the thesis committee. One of them has to be well-removed from my field of study. I'd love to see someone interested in and pursue these studies.

1. Synchronization of nanoscopic “fireflies” revealed by single-molecule microscopy
2. Two-dimensional mobility in lipid bilayer as a function of probe size measured by a single-molecule spring force gauge.
To my surprise, the idea outlined in this proposal was later reported by a [Science paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5942/870) to study another model system. What's more, the corresponding author of the paper had performed the work that motivated the PRL paper I published as a postdoc.
3. Dynamics of a cyclic Lotka-Volterra system in microfluidics.
